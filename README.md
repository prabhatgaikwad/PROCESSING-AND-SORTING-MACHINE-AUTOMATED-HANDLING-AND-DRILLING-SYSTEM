# PROCESSING-AND-SORTING-MACHINE-AUTOMATED-HANDLING-AND-DRILLING-SYSTEM
The project uses modular programming in CODESYS to automate product handling through various stages:

Piston Push: Initiates product movement.
Lever Pick-Up: Transports products to the elevator.
Elevator Lift: Raises products to a drilling position.
Drilling Operation: Positions products for precise drilling.
Turntable Sorting: Sorts products by color to assigned destinations.
An interactive HMI was built to facilitate real-time monitoring, control, and diagnostics, enhancing system usability and simplifying troubleshooting.

Features
Modular Programming: Simplifies debugging and improves automation flow.
Product Handling Stages: Efficient sequence control for various stages, from initial push to final sorting.
Color-Based Sorting: Intelligent color detection to determine product destinations.
HMI Visualization: Real-time monitoring and control interface for system diagnostics.
Optimized Control Logic: Custom logic implemented to ensure seamless handling and minimize downtime.
Technologies
CODESYS: Main development environment for programming control logic.
HMI Visualization: Interactive interface created for real-time operation monitoring.
Modular Sequence Control: CODESYS modularity enhances flexibility and troubleshooting.
